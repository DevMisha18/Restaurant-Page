I met a problem: 
when I add styles, they start collapsing with each other. 

I tried:
* removing them, and adding again, which met another problem that webpack wouldn't run import() again(idk why, mb becauses it caches sth)
* disabling, but turns out style tag doesn't have disabled attribute

Eventually a gave up, because the point of the project was in learning webpack, not messing around with disabling, removing style tags.
May be in future I will come back smarter and better and fix this, for now: no.
